Smart Tank Monitor (Hydroleum Solution)
A professional, real-time Internet of Things (IoT) dashboard designed for monitoring petrol pump fuel tanks. This application provides live contamination status, critical alerts, and detailed historical data analytics to ensure fuel integrity and operational safety.

The UI is built to a high standard, featuring a responsive, soft-shadow aesthetic optimized for clarity and ease of use.

‚ú® Key Features
This application delivers critical monitoring capabilities to prevent costly fuel contamination:

Real-time Monitoring: Dynamic display of Water Level, Petrol Purity, Pump State, and Emergency Switch status with a 15-second data refresh interval from external IoT APIs.

Dynamic Visualization: Animated tank representation with wave effects and dynamic color-coding to visualize contamination levels.

Multi-Level Alerts: Integration with external IoT and ML endpoints to provide multi-level alerts:

Warning State: Visual flag if Water Level > 16%.

Critical Alert: Audio and visual pulsing alert if Water Level > 20%.

Historical Data & Reporting: Dedicated history viewer supporting filtering by date range and status.

Client-Side PDF Export: Functionality to generate and export professional, structured PDF reports of historical data.

Responsive UI: Fully optimized layout using a 12-column grid system for seamless viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
